# Sales Forecasting Project
This project focuses on forecasting sales data using historical records to build predictive models that help optimize inventory, reduce costs, and improve business decisions.

## Key Outcomes
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed an XGBoost regression model to accurately forecast sales, achieving an R² of 0.999 and RMSE of 56.66, which can help reduce inventory risks and plan stock more efficiently.
- **Data Insights**: Analyzed sales data to understand trends, high-performing products, and customer behaviors, providing actionable insights for business strategy.
- **Visualization**: Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales trends, monthly/quarterly performance, and deal sizes, making insights accessible to stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Modeling**: XGBoost Regression, Model Evaluation (R², RMSE)
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## How to Explore the Project
- **Full Analysis**: The complete code and analysis are available in the `Sales_Forecasting_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
- **Final Report**: The interactive Power BI report is saved as a PDF in this repository under `Sales_Forecasting_Report.pdf`.
